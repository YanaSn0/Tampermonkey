- Min 500ms max 1500ms is a random delay for clicking unfollow to mimic human interaction.

- Batch 5 is how many cells it scans at once, client side so safe as long as don't set to high. Set to like 15 to 20 if you know it's going to be skipping them all to speed it up then set back to 5 or 6 once it starts finding them.

- Scan 100ms is the delay after finished processing the batch. it can be 0 or negative value but un tested 100 is low already.

- Scroll 107px is where the top cell in the batch lines up with top of page so right at the cutoff line to read it.

- It might stop and say it's done if alt tab then have to click start again.
